The Basic Calculator Web App is a simple web application designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
Users can input two numbers through prompts, select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) by clicking corresponding buttons,
and then view the result of the calculation. The app provides a user-friendly interface, responsive design, and visually pleasing styling.

#Features:

Operations: The app supports four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Visual Feedback: Buttons change appearance when hovered over or clicked, providing visual feedback to users.
Styling: Stylish design with rounded borders, contrasting button colors, and resizable fonts for a modern look.

#Implementation Details:

The web app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML is used to structure the page and include buttons, spans for displaying numbers and results, and the necessary elements for the user interface.
CSS is used to style the app, with custom styles for buttons, spans, and the background.
JavaScript handles user input, button click events, and calculation logic.
The app uses flexbox for centering and aligning elements both horizontally and vertically.
The background image is set using CSS to cover the full viewport.
Event listeners are attached to the operation buttons, triggering the corresponding calculation functions when clicked.
The calculated result is displayed in the designated "sum-el" span.
